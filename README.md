Description:
This programm generates a set of 375 images (PNG) representing the distortion of the light rays passing near a black hole. On each frame, the black hole's positions is shifted of one pixel to the left in order to create a movie after merging all the frames. You can use any software to create a movie with the frames.
This programm works with some equations of the general relativity.

- You need about 6 GB of free space to store the 375 frames.

The simulation can take few minutes 

How to run the programm:
- Run the 'make' command to compile the files
- Run the binary file './simulation'

All the pictures will be stored in the result folder.
